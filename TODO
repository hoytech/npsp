-Extend Istvan Standard Format:
  -Support variable bases
  -Remove the Autosave line
  -Put in a decent standard header

-Make sure -n supports ALL bases.

-Merge Various Optimizations from defrost

-Use a-z for supporting bases 2-36, rather than 2-16 as defrost's code does.

-Be able to specify multiple numbers on the command line... Maybe...
